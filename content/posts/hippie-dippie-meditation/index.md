### And how I discovered Buddhist practice

> A quick comment: I started writing this post in July, and since then a lot happened (as I will describe in the post). Reading through it, annotating and adding to the post now, at a later point in time, some of the things I wrote are not "correct" any more, or I have changed my point of view. I will go ahead and leave the original passages but will write commentary in blockquotes in between.

It just happens for the fraction of a moment, but it happens reliably: everytime I hear the word "meditation" or even just **think** it, my mind splits and holds two thoughts at once:

1.  Meditation is for buddhists, hippies, cult leaders from California and just a fringe thing that never works, and:
2.  I'm in awe of anybody who can achieve a state of mindfulness, this is amazing and actually I can feel the benefit of it!

Literally, at the same time, those two thoughts coexist in my head, but thankfully only for an instant. Or, maybe I should say: I have learned to put away my weird preconceptions and stereotypical notions of people who meditate.

> I find it pretty funny that my first thought is "meditation is for buddhists" with a kind of dismissve tone; funny because I now follow a daily Buddhist practice.

I have "tried" to "use" meditation several times in the past (why so many quotation marks, you ask? I'll come back to that). Together with my partner we checked out [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) which we used for a while and did guided meditations and meditations for specific purposes (like sleep), but after the first subscription we didn't engage with it again. After that, I made on and off attempts at meditating - with YouTube videos or other free apps, breathing exercises and such, but it never worked out.

It was not until **after** this recent focus on the connection between my **outside behavior** and my **mental processes** (experiencing more triggers of potential frustration, anxiety, stress, aggression etc.) that I re-discovered meditation. It of course came with my recent interest in everything happiness and all of the info I gained by listening to the [Happiness Lab](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/the-happiness-lab-with-dr-laurie-santos) podcast, science articles I cross-referenced and chats I had with my partner, that I decided to give meditation a chance. I do believe it was in my favorite web development podcast (shout out to [SyntaxFM](https://syntax.fm/)) that the meditation app [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) was mentioned (in [this](https://syntax.fm/show/532/supper-club-coding-with-adhd-with-dr-courtney-tolinski) episode), which is why I downloaded it, got the subscription and started scrolling through it.

It was a bit difficult for me to maneuver, since I wasn't super familiar with the terminology - or not anymore, that is. A lot of "mindfulness" and "awareness" and such, all terms that have a general meaning and a specific one; I didn't know exactly what I wanted. So I googled "headspace happiness" or something like that, scrolled through the results and came across something akin to "how to deal with frustration, have more patience and acceptance" and the like and I thought: **wow**, that is ****exactly**** what I'm looking for! So what I did is, I downloaded some of the exercises and courses, since the next day we would be on a ten hour flight across the Atlantic, without WiFi or mobile data or anything like that. And a ten hour flight - even with a small child - is just a lot of time lying around there, when the only things you can do are 1. sitting uncomfortably, 2. standing, 3. walking back and forth, 4. changing diapers, 5. be tired, 6.watch movie after movie, 7. read.

Usually I go for the "movie after movie" thing, if given the chance - our child was pretty relaxed, wanted to climb a lot, napped a bit, and was very excited about The Lady and The Tramp, but didn't need much in terms of our entertainment. This time I deliberately left the screen off (I suspect it has a lot to do with me getting tension headaches), and whenever I got a few minutes, I either read, or turned on a podcast or - you guessed it - a meditation. At that point I kind of randomly accessed the downloads and started the meditation, which were all kind of the same - which is not a bad thing necessarily. It's a lot to do with breathing - focused (but not too focused) on the in- and especially the out-breath. The out-breath, as I later learned, is an access to the parasympathetic nervous system and activates the vagus nerve, all of which calms the mind and body and ends a "fight-or-flight" response in stress situations. In situations that are not perceived life or death, it still is calming on the nerves. And in a plane that is a good thing to have.

#### Disclaimer

I have started writing this blog post at the beginning of July, when I - as said above - discovered happiness research and the actual physical benefit of meditation. I started using the headspace app and practiced "meditation", in the very physical sense ("western", as a lot of books describe it) - basically, I did the exercise with calming thoughts. Almost like the Western version of Yoga, which is almost exclusively focussing on the movements.

As these things go, one meditation exercise went to the next - I looked through the Headspace app a bit and found whole courses on managing anger and eperiencing grief, advice for parents as well as decompressing after physical exercise. I also continued listening to The Happiness Lab, until one morning at the end of our US trip, when I walked my daughter along the river - it was swelteringly hot and humid, but staying with the family wasn't an option any more (for reasons). So I walked her in the stroller until she fell asleep - and listened to the podcast, with an episode about Robert Wright who had written a book called "Why Buddhism is True". Intriguing title, right?

I always had a kind of passive admiration for Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and Asian religions in general - mostly, because it was so unfamiliar with me due to cultural differencess, and all of it kind of shrouded in mystery. So I listened to Robert Wright talking about his book on why Buddhism is True. While provoking, the book points out the parallels between Buddhist teachings and physiological and psychosomatic processes - the lens of Westerners on Buddhist practice, so to speak. It was a lot of evolutionary psychology and biology, which, because of my partner, is something I came to regard quite highly. So I kept listening - and then I got the book and started reading.

The book is a discussion as well as an account of personal experiences by the author, and of course it references other studies as well as Buddhist philospohies - which in turn then was my gateway into Buddhist teachings, broadly speaking. I checked out some of the sutras mentioned in the book, looked up the history of the Buddha and Buddhist schools and so on, just so see who said what when about what and how it actually (almost all of it) has ties to reality and visible evidence. Regarding spirituality, I was pretty "scarred" (which might be a big word) - but definitely tired of it. I spent a lot of time with Christian doctrine, and the religious organization of it just made tired of it. Also, I don't believe - and either you do, or you don't.

With the Buddhist writings (allegorical or cryptic as they might be), I don't have to believe. The ways some things are expressed are rather - weird, sure, but: nobody says that, at the end of the day, higher power is what is responsible and you better repent, or else. The responsibility is with you, but there are tools to help - that's what I understand Buddhism to be, essentially. Well, I do NOW - but back in July (only five months ago, sure) I had zero idea of what all of that could mean for me.

In August and September, all three of us took a few trips through Europe, and in my spare time I tried myself at a meditation practice - observing some rules I encountered, just to try them out, if they were for me. So, I tried out a routine - ritual was still a bit of a too big word - of words and meditation. And I read more - the book on why Buddhism was true led me to the Heart Sutra, which led me, of course, to Thich Nhat Hanh.

### Choice overload and selection inertia - too many schools?

Thich Nhat Hanh is a name I had never heard before, and after reading about him (now, a few months later), I ask myself really why I have never heard of this person before. In his biography you will learn that he opposed the Vietnam War (called the American War in Vietnam) from both sides, got exiled for that from his home country, worked with Dr Martin Luther King Jr. and got nominated by him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and made countless efforts around the world for more peace and social work. But aside from that he also wrote about a gazillion books on Engaged Buddhism, bringing the practice and wisdom of Buddhism to the Western world. And this is also how I got to read what he wrote - mostly, because Reddit was very helpful in providing this knowledge.

At the same time, my partner and I took the offer of a friend (a vegan and Buddhist) to participate in one of their practice sessions. They belong to the Soka Gakkai movement, a Japanese Buddhist group practicing Nichiren Buddhism, which involves chanting the Daimoku and the veneration of the Gohonzon. In Nichiren Buddhism, the Lotus Sutra is held to be the main (and only) Sutra that contains the wisdom of all other Sutras.

Practicing with this group of Nichiren Buddhists was very cool, and it felt really connecting to sit in a room with Buddhists that "didn't look like Buddhists" - no orange robes or shaved heads. Thus far I had never sat with Buddhist lay people - and of course, never seen a monastic up close. So that felt pretty real to me.

That said - the chanting didn't click with me. The gist of the matter is that chanting the Daimoku basically opens a connection between you and the world and the Buddhahood inside you. It's kind of like "magic", in the sense that you don't need to understand the words for them to "work". And while I'm sure that this is a very uncomplex and flat representation of the practice of the Soka Gakkai (which I don't want to insult or debase) - the chanting and "magic" aspect of the pracitce did not connect with me at all. Before joining that practice, the most familiar of Buddhist practices for me was Zen, and of course only from TV and books that talk about Zen masters and how they achieve great feats. So I looked more into that (also, because there is a Zen center in the city we live in) and got more into the sitting in silence and living in the moment kind of meditative practice. So when I encountered people feverishly chanting together, it did't sit quite right with me. Nevertheless, the experience helped me a lot - I read more about Nichiren Buddhism, and in turn more about other schools of Buddhism, and thus got even more into the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh and the tradition he and his fellow nuns and monks established with Plum Village.
