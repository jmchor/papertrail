### And how practicing mindfulness is something for everybody

It just happens for the fraction of a moment, but it happens reliably: everytime I hear the word "meditation" or even just **think** it, my mind splits and holds two thoughts at once:

1.  Meditation is for buddhists, hippies, cult leaders from California and just a fringe thing that never works, and:
2.  I'm in awe of anybody who can achieve a state of mindfulness, this is amazing and actually I can feel the benefit of it!

Literally, at the same time, those two thoughts coexist in my head, but thankfully only for an instant. Or, maybe I should say: I have learned to put away my weird preconceptions and stereotypical notions of people who meditate.

I have "tried" to "use" meditation several times in the past (why so many quotation marks, you ask? I'll come back to that). Together with my partner we checked out [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) which we used for a while and did guided meditations and meditations for specific purposes (like sleep), but after the first subscription we didn't engage with it again. After that, I made on and off attempts at meditating - with YouTube videos or other free apps, breathing exercises and such, but it never worked out.

It was not until **after** this recent focus on the connection between my ****outside behavior**** and my ****mental processes**** (experiencing more triggers of potentially experiencing frustration, anxiety, stress, aggression etc.) that I re-discovered meditation. It of course came with my recent interest in everything happiness and all of the info I gained by listening to the [Happiness Lab](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/the-happiness-lab-with-dr-laurie-santos) podcast, science articles I cross-referenced and chats I had with my partner, that I decided to give meditation a chance. I do believe it was in my favorite web development podcast (shout out to [SyntaxFM](https://syntax.fm/)) that the meditation app [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) was mentioned (in [this](https://syntax.fm/show/532/supper-club-coding-with-adhd-with-dr-courtney-tolinski) episode), which is why I downloaded it, got the subscription and started scrolling through it.

It was a bit difficult for me to maneuver, since I wasn't super familiar with the terminology - or not anymore, that is. A lot of "mindfulness" and "awareness" and such, all terms that have a general meaning and a specific one; I didn't know exactly what I wanted. So I googled "headspace happiness" or something like that, scrolled through the results and came across something akin to "how to deal with frustration, have more patience and acceptance" and the like and I thought: **wow**, that is ****exactly**** what I'm looking for! So what I did is, I downloaded some of the exercises and courses, since the next day we would be on a ten hour flight across the Atlantic, without WiFi or mobile data or anything like that. And a ten hour flight - even with a small child - is just a lot of time lying around there, when the only things you can do are 1. sitting uncomfortably, 2. standing, 3. walking back and forth, 4. changing diapers, 5. be tired, 6.watch movie after movie, 7. read.

Usually I go for the "movie after movie" thing, if given the chance - our child was pretty relaxed, wanted to climb a lot, napped a bit, and was very excited about The Lady and The Tramp, but didn't need much in terms of our entertainment. This time I deliberately left the screen off (I suspect it has a lot to do with me getting tension headaches), and whenever I got a few minutes, I either read, or turned on a podcast or - you guessed it - a meditation. At that point I kind of randomly accessed the downloads and started the meditation, which were all kind of the same - which is not a bad thing necessarily. It's a lot to do with breathing - focused (but not too focused) on the in- and especially the out-breath. The out-breath, as I later learned, is an access to the parasympathetic nervous system and activates the vagus nerve, all of which calms the mind and body and ends a "fight-or-flight" response in stress situations. In situations that are not perceived life or death, it still is calming on the nerves. And in a plane that is a good thing to have.
